This is a WIP

Install Windows Terminal Preview from the microsoft store(if you cannot access the microsoft store, you can install it from the windows terminal github): `https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab`

Clone the repo:
`https://github.com/JackRKelly/PowerShellCustomization.git`

Run the `PowerShell/init.ps1` to install all required modules

Install the font in `Fonts/CascadiaCode`

Make sure all paths are accurate in the `WindowsTerminal/settings.json`, will automate this eventually
